## Projects List
Projects are always courses' projects at EPFL. SAD >_<
### 1. Movie Recommendation
This is the final project of NTDS course. Our team uses date sets from [kaggle](kaggle.com). As we first wrote our own project for recommendation engine, this project seems a little bit simple. 
#### - Data
[MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/)
Stable benchmark dataset. 20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications applied to 27,000 movies by 138,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags. Released 4/2015; updated 10/2016 to update links.csv and add tag genome data.
We used all three .csv file for recommendation with different pruposes: movie recommendations for movie and user.
#### - Codes
As course required, we need to write jupyter notebook for final presentation. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/peggy95/movie_recommendation/tree/master/code).
#### - Presentation
Benefitting from the course presentation, there is a [PPT](https://github.com/peggy95/movie_recommendation/blob/master/ppt.key) for this project.
#### - Improvement
After learning other advanced methods for recommendation, shallow learning like Collaborative Filtering based on items or users and deep learning like DCN, DeepFMs can be employed for recommendation in terms of these data sets.
